> 🔍 **A fast, reliable phone number OSINT tool**

Ignorant allows you to check if a phone number is associated with accounts on various platforms like Amazon, Instagram, and Snapchat. This is a complete Rust port of the original Python tool, offering better performance, memory safety, and zero runtime dependencies.

**⚠️ Important**: This tool does not alert the target phone number and is designed for defensive security purposes and OSINT research.

  -V, --version           Print version information
```

### Examples
```bash
# Basic check
ignorant 1 5551234567

# Only show platforms where the number exists
ignorant 44 7700900000 --only-used

# Disable colors and clearing for logging
ignorant 33 612345678 --no-color --no-clear

# Set custom timeout
ignorant 49 1234567890 --timeout 30
```

## 📤 Output Format

The tool outputs results in a clear, color-coded format:
- 🟢 **[+]** Phone number found on platform
- 🟣 **[-]** Phone number not found on platform
- 🔴 **[x]** Rate limited or error occurred

Each result includes:
```json
{
  "name": "instagram",
  "domain": "instagram.com",
  "method": "other",
  "frequent_rate_limit": false,
  "rate_limit": false,
  "exists": false
}
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific module tests
cargo test modules::amazon

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration_tests
```

### Building
```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release
```

## 🛡️ Rate Limiting

If you encounter rate limits:
- Use a VPN or proxy to change your IP address
- Increase the timeout with `--timeout`
- Wait between requests
- Consider using different user agents (tool rotates automatically)
